<p> The Mountain Gorilla's are known for being powerful but also gentle giants with incredible strength.<br>
These endangered primates are known for being in the forests of central Africa but are difficult to track<br>
because of their shy nature and their remote habitats. The mountain gorilla are known as well to have strong and close family bonds<br>
especially when it comes to mating, where the male gorilla will protect the female gorilla and their family with their life.<br>
The silverback, which is considered to be the alpha male protect the group and are the dominant leaders of their group as well.<br>
